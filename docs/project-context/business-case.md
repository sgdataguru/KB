# CLP AI Knowledge Management - Business Case

## Executive Summary

CLP faces an industry-wide challenge of **knowledge transfer** from senior experts to the next generation of workers. The proposed solution is an AI-powered knowledge management system that leverages existing video training content and documentation to create an intelligent chatbot that can help junior staff quickly find answers to their questions.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- Senior experts possess critical institutional knowledge
- Knowledge is scattered across video recordings and documents in SharePoint
- Junior staff struggle to find relevant information quickly
- Training videos can be up to 1 hour long, making it difficult to locate specific information
- No centralized AI-powered search capability exists

### Business Impact
- Slow knowledge transfer slows down onboarding
- Senior staff time is consumed answering repetitive questions
- Risk of knowledge loss as senior experts retire
- Inefficient training processes across departments

---

## Proposed Solution

### Phase 1: Semi AI Knowledge Management Solution (MVP)

Build an AI-powered chatbot that:
- Analyzes existing video content and training documents
- Converts videos to searchable transcripts
- Allows junior staff to ask questions in natural language
- Points users to **exact timestamps** in videos (e.g., "Go to this video at 30 minutes")
- Provides source references for all answers
- Only answers questions from the approved knowledge base (no hallucinations)

### Phase 2: Ultimate Solution (Future State)

Extend the platform to include:
- **AI Avatar** - Text-to-speech avatar using real person's likeness for classroom training
- **Multi-department agents** - Specialized agents for HR, Legal, and Technical departments
- **AI Governance** via AI Foundry
- **Short video generation** from longer training content
- Integration with **Viva Learning** platform
- **Management console** for document references and implementation plans
